# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Purpose
This statistical analysis serves to help an automobile manufacturer determine:
  1. which variables in the dataset of a series of cars predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
  2. the summary statistics on the PSI of the suspension coils from 3 different manufacturing lots
  3. if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
In addition, we will design a study comparing the MechaCar to other cars

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
